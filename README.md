# 3D Game Engine
This is an attempt at building a very rudimentary console based 3D game engine from nothing (using Windows functions for the console). 

It works mostly like Wolfenstien3D, the popular game from the 80s which everyone had at some point.

**Although,** this wont be anywhere near as good as what others have made, and nowhere close to what actual game engines are like.

Inspiration and the knowledge that this can be done came from the work of javidx9 oh YouTube.
